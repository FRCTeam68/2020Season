IF THE PATH IS RUNNING THE SAME WITHOUT PID
YOUR MAX VELOCITY IS THE SAME AS MAX ACCELERATION
IN THE SETTINGS OF BOBTRAJECTORY CHANGE THE MAX ACCELERATION
TO BE EITHER 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, OR 3/4 OF THE MAX VELOCITY
PID DOES NOT CONTROL DISTANCE, BUT CONTROLS THE RATE
AT WHICH THE ROBOT ACCELERATES AND DECCELERATES
THIS DOES CHANGE THE TOTAL DISTANCE
*NOTE*
MAKE SURE TO ACTUALLY TO CALCULATE THE ACCELERATION AND 
VELOCITY OF THE ROBOT IF BOBTRAJECTORY SEES THE MAX 
VELOCITY TO BE 1FT PER SECOND EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE
7FT PER SECOND IT WILL RUN THE ROBOT AT MAX SPEED FOR
A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, IN RETURN MAKING IT RUN LONGER
