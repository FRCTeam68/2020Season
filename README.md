# 2020Season
Projects for the 2020 season
Although the 2020Vision is under the 2020 season repo
we are using the 2019 robot to practice vision on
We are using the parade robot to practice Auton
using the NAVX

The code we have under this repository is to start
using the new working area that WPILIB has provided
for us.
